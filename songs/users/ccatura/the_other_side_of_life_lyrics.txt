[song-section-name]VERSE 1[/song-section-name]
[song-section]
Never ending sky
I feel so small when crowds go by
I still wonder why
Some belong to homes
But, I am still alone
I can feel this heart of paper
Growing colder
Wish each beat was
[/song-section]

[song-section-name]CHORUS[/song-section-name]
[song-section]
Stronger, longer
These wishes that I'm keeping
I’m living while I’m sleeping
I want more, but long for night time to arrive
To live on the other side of life
[/song-section]

[song-section-name]VERSE 2[/song-section-name]
[song-section]
Ever growing world
A love-filled little boy or girl
At least that’s what I’ve earned
It’s easier to say
That love will find a way
But, I can feel this heart grow weaker
Tired but eager
Wish each beat was
[/song-section]

[song-section-name]BRIDGE[/song-section-name]
[song-section]
Where children grow and know their lives flow by them like a stream
I want to live the things that I can only dream
[/song-section]
